# Lab7GeometryApplicationsInInformatics

Write a program (in Python) to determine a point on a cubic B-spline curve in a plane with 5 control points using de Boor's algorithm . The input data will be:
- the 5 control points;
- the 9 nodes;
- tâˆˆ[t3,t5], 
 
And the result must be r(t). The input data must be able to be entered interactively or via a data file. If you choose the latter, attach an example of a data file to the program.
